    History and Evolution of Node.js :

    - Node.js was created by Ryan Dahl in 2009 as a response to the limitations of traditional server-side technologies like Apache. 
    Dahl wanted a solution that could handle asynchronous, non-blocking operations efficiently, leading to the creation of Node.js, 
    which is built on the V8 JavaScript engine.

/* Defination of Node js : 

    Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment that allows developers to run JavaScript code 
    outside the browser. It is built on Chromeâ€™s V8 engine and uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, making it lightweight, 
    efficient, and ideal for scalable web applications.

/* Architecture of Node.js */

    /** Single-Threaded, Event-Driven: Unlike traditional web servers, Node.js uses a single thread with an event loop, making it highly efficient for handling multiple connections concurrently. **/

    /** Non-Blocking I/O: Instead of waiting for one task to complete before starting another, Node.js can handle multiple operations simultaneously. **/

    /** V8 Engine: The JavaScript V8 engine (developed by Google for Chrome) compiles JavaScript into machine code, making Node.js applications faster. **/

    /** Modules & Package Management: The Node Package Manager (npm) allows developers to install and use third-party libraries, making development faster and easier. **/

/* Key Features of Node.js */

    // - Asynchronous and Event-Driven: Ideal for handling real-time applications.
    // - Cross-Platform: Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
    // - Scalability: Supports microservices and distributed systems.
    // - Large Community & npm: Thousands of open-source packages are available.
